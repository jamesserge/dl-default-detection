Deep Learning on Lending Club Data
This project uses a deep neural network to predict the likelihood of a loan not being repaid using Lending Clubâ€™s public loan dataset. The goal is to identify default risk early using borrower information available at loan issuance. While overall accuracy was comparable to XGBoost, the DNN model showed strong confidence in high-risk predictions, making it a useful tool for risk-averse decision-making.

Key tools: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
