# ðŸ§  Deep Learning on Lending Club Data

This project applies a deep neural network to predict the likelihood of a loan not being repaid, using the publicly available Lending Club data.

The goal is to identify **loan default risk early**, using only borrower information available **at the time of loan issuance** â€” before any repayments occur.

While the overall predictive performance was comparable to XGBoost, the deep neural network (DNN) model stood out for its strong confidence in high-risk predictions, making it especially valuable for risk-averse decision-making.
